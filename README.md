[Installation Page](https://www.github.com/Pilot1782/bad_copenheimer/wiki/Installation)

## Usage
The first time you use this bot, run 

>/help

This shows all of the commands you can use and their usage. Then to create your server list, run:

>/server_scan

This will get a list of all active minecraft servers, you may want to set the threads higher than the current value. This will take several hours to complete.

## Important

In order for /status to work properly the server should have enable-query=true in the server.properties file. This allows the server to brodcast who is currently logged onto the server.
